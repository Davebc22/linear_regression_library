# Linear Regression System in Java

## I. Introduction
This project aims to implement a linear regression system using the Java programming language. The system enables predictions based on data stored in a spreadsheet and saves the results in a database. To achieve this, the Apache POI library is employed to read data from the spreadsheet, and the JDBC library is used to establish connection and operations with the database. Additionally, the PlantUML library is utilized to generate UML diagrams representing the structure and relationships between the project's classes. Through this system, the application of linear regression in a Java environment is demonstrated, providing a tool for making predictions based on historical data.

## II. Results
The obtained results showcase that the implemented linear regression system can predict output values based on input data. A test was conducted using a spreadsheet with sample data, yielding accurate and consistent results. The linear regression function calculated from the data reliably estimates output values for new input data. Furthermore, it was verified that the results are correctly stored in the database, ensuring the persistence of information and facilitating subsequent analysis.

## III. Conclusions
In conclusion, the linear regression system implemented in this project demonstrates the viability of using the Java programming language to make predictions based on historical data. The integration of the Apache POI and JDBC libraries simplifies data reading from a spreadsheet and connection to a database, respectively. Additionally, generating UML diagrams with PlantUML facilitates the visualization and understanding of the project's structure. This system can be applied in various contexts where predictions or analysis of historical data are required.
